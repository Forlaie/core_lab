## About the Project
This project was created in collaboration with a professor to highlight their research team. The core requirement was a simple platform to list lab members and their publications. I expanded on this by proposing and implementing additional features that made the site more engaging and user-friendly.

This was also one of my **first experiences with React and JavaScript**. I took on the challenge to learn new tools, experimenting and building iteratively. Over the course of one to two months, I delivered a functional, production-ready website while gaining hands-on experience with modern web development.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd research-lab-website
npm install
npm run dev
